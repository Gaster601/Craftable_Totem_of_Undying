# Craftable_Totem_of_Undying
A Forge mod for Minecraft Java 1.19.2. Adds recipes for crafting the Totem of Undying


We all know the hassle of searching for Evokers. We all know some mods that use the Totem of Undying in their crafting recipes.

So what can we do if we simply don't find Evokers and/or can't get one to drop?


Easy, use this mod! It adds a quite pricy alternative to getting it as a drop.
The recipes use vanilla components, so no dependencies to other mods.
